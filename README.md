[Install Rust and cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html), then run using

```
cargo run -r
```

Runtime arguments will be printed to the screen, and these all do different things.

To run a computation that calculates the optimal opening move for every possible deal, run

```
cargo run -r -- --all-length
```
