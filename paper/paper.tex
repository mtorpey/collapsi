\abstract{ Collapsi is a two-player game of complete information released in
  June 2025 by Mark~S.~Ball of \emph{Riffle Shuffle \& Roll}. Played with two
  pawns on a torroidal board of 16 randomly mixed playing cards, players take it
  in turns to move based on the value of the card they sit on, with the game
  ending when a player has no legal moves.

  The number of possible deals after symmetry breaking is low enough, and the
  game tree is shallow enough, to make an exhaustive analysis of the game
  feasible. A search was applied revealing that the first player can force a win
  in TODO of deals, with the second player able forcing a win in all others. In
  TODO of deals the losing player can prolong the game to the maximum length of
  14 plies, and a win can never be forced in less than 7 plies.

\section{The game}

The rules for Collapsi are hosted by the designer in a living document
\cite{rules} and in the game's introductory YouTube video \cite{youtube}. The
board is a set of 16 playing cards taken from a standard deck -- four aces, four
2s, four 3s, two 4s and two jacks -- shuffled and arranged into a $4\times 4$
grid, an example layout being shown in Figure \ref{fig:board}. Each player uses
one pawn (red or blue) and places it on a jack, then play begins.
